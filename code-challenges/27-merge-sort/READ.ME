#Merge sort is an example of a divide-and-conquer #type sorting-algorithm. The input for merge sort #is an array of integers of length n, which needs #to be sorted, typically from least to greatest. #What merge sort does is it splits the unsorted #array into two parts and then you recursively #apply merge sort to these sub-arrays to further #split the arrays until you are left with a bunch #of single-element arrays. Then, you compare #single-element arrays to one another before #recombining them into a two-element, sorted array #(and so on). If you do this repeatedly, #eventually you end up with a single, sorted array #of length n. Sorting algorithms are surprisingly #complicated to grasp at first and Iâ€™m still #trying to wrap my mind around the intricacies of #computer sorting in general, but here is my #attempt at implementing merge sort in JavaScript:
