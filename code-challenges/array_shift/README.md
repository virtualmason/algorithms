# array_shift




Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms.
Create a new branch in your repo called array_shift.
Your top-level readme should contain a “Table of Contents” navigation to all of your challenges and implementations so far. (Don’t forget to update it!)
This assignment should be completed within the challenges subdirectory of the repository.
On your branch, create…

JavaScript: a folder named arrayShift which contains a file called array-shift.js

NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
Example
Input	Output
[2,4,6,8], 5	[2,4,5,6,8]
[4,8,15,23,42], 16	[4,8,15,16,23,42]
Stretch Goal
Once you’ve achieved a working solution, write a second function that removes an element from the middle index and shifts other elements in the array to fill the new gap.

Requirements
Ensure your complete solution follows the standard requirements.

Write unit tests
Follow the template for a well-formatted README
